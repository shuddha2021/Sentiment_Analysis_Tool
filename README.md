# Zenify

Zenify is a simple and fun web app that analyzes the sentiment of any sentence using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses a basic logic to determine whether the sentence is positive, negative, or neutral, and displays the result with a corresponding color and sound effect. You can try it out here: https://sentiment-analysis-tool.vercel.app/

## How it works

Zenify uses the following JavaScript concepts to implement the sentiment analysis functionality:

- Variables and constants
- Strings and string methods
- Conditional statements
- Functions
- Event listeners
- DOM manipulation
- Audio objects

The app consists of three main components: the input field, the submit button, and the output element. The user can type a sentence in the input field and click the submit button to see the sentiment result. The app then calls a function that takes the user input as an argument and returns a sentiment value based on some simple rules. For example, if the sentence contains words like "love", "happy", or "great", the function returns "positive". If it contains words like "hate", "sad", or "terrible", it returns "negative". Otherwise, it returns "neutral".

The app then displays the sentiment value in the output element with a corresponding color and sound effect. For example, if the sentiment is positive, the output element will have a green color and play a cheerful sound. If it is negative, it will have a red color and play a sad sound. If it is neutral, it will have a gray color and play a calm sound.

The app also clears the input field after displaying the result, focuses on the input field for convenience, and resets the output element class after a slight delay.
